## Welcome to Apty Session repo

This is collections of examples and sample code that we have discussed and written examples. 

## Contribution Guidelines
1. Always start folder name number, which helps the order in which one can start. 
    ```
    ├── ...
    ├── 01-JavaScript                
    │   ├── 01-feature        
    │       ├── README.md   
    │   ├── README.md 
    ├── 02-React                
    │   ├── 01-feature        
    │       ├── README.md   
    │   ├── README.md 
    ├── README.md   
    └──
    ```
2. Always have README in feature folder with references to specific feature. 

3. Do not merge code directly to **master** branch
